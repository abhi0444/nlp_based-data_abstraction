# Data Abstraction using NLP

The overwhelming amount of unstructured text data available today provides a rich source of information if the data can be structured. Using this technique we can get key points from the data which can be used for further analysis.

We will be able to get at a minimum, who, and what, the information contains using this approach.

## The type of Information we can get through the data are mentioned below
